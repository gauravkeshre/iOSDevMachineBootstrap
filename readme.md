# Setting up new machine for iOS development

> Important: Some of the steps are not even iOS development specific. Just for regular developer tools and scripts to catalyze the development process.

## Set up development directory

It is good practice to create a `Workspace` directory at `~/`
There you can create following directory

```
root
+-- Workspace
    +-- git
        +-- <forked repositories>
    +-- work
        +-- <project name>
        +-- documentations
        +-- design
```
